# ELEC5280_IF_Amplifier_TSMC28nm
This IF amplifier is a circuit block in TSMC28nm designed for ELEC5280 final project.
A typical structure for the IF amplifier is the differential amplifier with resistive loads as shown below. This structure can provide a moderate gain with high bandwidth while consuming low power. Additionally, the IF amp in this case also worked as a low-pass filter (LPF) to eliminate the image frequency.

The simulation results also show that:
Power consumption (including Ibias) ≈ 790.0 μW;
IIP3 = -6.656 dBm;
NF at 10 MHz = 6.286 dB; Flicker noise corner ≈ 15 MHz;
Gian at 10 MHz = 20.81 dB; -3dB bandwidth = 2.04 GHz.
